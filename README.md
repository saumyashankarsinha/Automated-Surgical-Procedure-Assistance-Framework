Due to the benefits for patients such as:
- less pain
- faster recovery

However, surgeons face a
number of obstacles while performing these surgeries, including inade-
quate depth perception, limited range of motion, and difficulty gauging
the force to be delivered in the tissue. As a result, improved support for
these surgeries is needed to provide surgeons with automated assistance,
reducing complications and needless patient damage.
