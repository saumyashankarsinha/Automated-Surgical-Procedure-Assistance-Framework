Automated Surgical Procedure Assistance Framework using Deep Learning and Formal Runtime Monitoring
There have been tremendous developments in minimally invasive approaches (e.g., laparoscopic Surgeries) for various surgical treatments.

Due to the benefits for patients such as:
- less pain
- faster recovery

However, surgeons face a
number of obstacles while performing these surgeries, including inade-
quate depth perception, limited range of motion, and difficulty gauging
the force to be delivered in the tissue. As a result, improved support for
these surgeries is needed to provide surgeons with automated assistance,
reducing complications and needless patient damage.
