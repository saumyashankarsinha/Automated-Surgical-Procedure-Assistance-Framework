# Automated-Surgical-Procedure-Assistance-Framework
Automated Surgical Procedure Assistance Framework using Deep Learning and Formal Runtime Monitoring.


There have been tremendous developments in minimally invasive approaches (e.g., laparoscopic Surgeries) for various surgical treatments.

Due to the benefits for patients such as:
- less pain
- faster recovery

However, surgeons face a number of obstacles while performing these surgeries, including
- inadequate depth perception
- limited range of motion
- difficulty gauging the force to be delivered in the tissue

As a result, improved support for these surgeries is needed to provide surgeons with automated assistance,reducing complications and needless patient damage. We propose an approach to develop an automated surgical procedure assistance framework, leveraging:
- deep learning
- formal methods

## Overview of the Proposed Framework
The framework comprises of two modules: 
1. Tool identification module (deep learning)
    - we use Faster R-CNN to identify the surgical instruments/tools used to perform the surgical procedure.
2. Monitoring module (formal methods)
    - Based on the knowledge of the clinical guidelines from the domain expert surgeons, the key policies to be followed for safe
surgical procedure can be understood. 
    - From that understanding, we formally specify the policies from which a monitor is synthesized. 
    - The monitor will identify any bad behaviour during a surgical procedure by looking at the sequence, time of toolsâ€™
occurance, etc. and intimate the surgeons about it.
